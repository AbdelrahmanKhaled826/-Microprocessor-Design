# Microprocessor-Design
Simple as Possible (SAP) computers in general were designed to introduce beginners to some of the crucial ideas behind computer operations. SAP computers are classified into stages, each stage more evolved and considering more advanced concepts in computer architecture than the previous. 
The SAP-1 computer is the first stage in this evolution. Its primary purpose is to develop a basic understanding of how a computer works, interacts with memory and other parts of the system like input and output. The instruction set is very limited and is simple. 
> ## !The features in sap-1 computer are :
```
• W bus 8 bit. 
• 16 bytes memory. 
• Registers - are accumulator and B-register each of 8 bits. 
• Program counter. 
• Memory Address Register. 
• Adder/Subtracter. 
• Control Unit 
• Simple Output
```
> [!TIP]
> #### In this project, we implement a SAP-1 computer using Verilog , write a testbench for each block  and check functionality of the design ,also analysis the timing  reports  and get the netlist viewer .
